Q1. Write a program to find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?

Ans1.
          def pair_sum(arr, n, given_num):
              count = 0
              for i in range(0,n):
                  for j in range(i+1,n):
                      if arr[i]+arr[j] == given_num:
                          count+=1
              print("Number of pairs whose sum is equal to given number :",count)

          pair_sum([1,5,7,1],4,6)
          
          
          
          Output :- Number of pairs whose sum is equal to given number : 2
          
          
    
    
    
    
Q2. Write a program to reverse an array in place? In place means you cannot create a new array. You have to update the original array.    

Ans.
          def reverse_arr(arr):
              print("Reverse of given array is :",arr[::-1])

          reverse_arr([11,12,13,21,22,23])
          
          
          Output :- Reverse of given array is : [23, 22, 21, 13, 12, 11]
          
          
          
          
          
Q3. Write a program to check if two strings are a rotation of each other?

Ans3.
          str1 = input("Enter first string :")
          str2 = input("Enter second string :")
          n1 = len(str1)
          n2 = len(str2)
          concat = ''
          if n1 != n2:
              print("The two strings are not rotation of each other")
          else:
              concat = str1+str1
              if str2 in concat:
                  print("The two strings are rotation of each other")
              else:
                  print("The two strings are not rotation of each other")
                  
                  
          
          Input1 :-  Enter first string :ABCDE
                     Enter second string :DEACB
          Output1 :- The two strings are not rotation of each other
          
          
          Input2 :-  Enter first string :ABCDE
                     Enter second string :CDEAB
          Output2 :- The two strings are rotation of each other
          
          
          Input3 :-  Enter first string :ABCDE
                     Enter second string :CDE
          Output3 :- The two strings are not rotation of each other
          
          
          
          
          

Q4. Write a program to print the first non-repeated character from a string?

Ans4.
          def FirstNonRepeatedChar(str):
              for i in str:
                  count=0
                  for j in str:
                      if i==j:
                          count+=1
                      if count>1:
                          break
                  if count==1:
                      return i
                      
          FirstNonRepeatedChar("edyoda is a platform to learn everyday ")
          
          Output :-  'i'
